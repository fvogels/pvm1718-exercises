/*
    Explanations are spread over the different test cpp's.

    Pay attention to what header files the tests include so as to know
    where to put your own code. The tests should not be changed in any way.

    NOTE: I'm not done writing all explanations. If no explanations
          are present in the test file, either you haven't pulled them in yet,
          or I haven't written them yet. I intend to have finished writing
          them by the end of April.
